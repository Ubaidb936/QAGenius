5. REPORT YOUR INJURIES TO YOUR 
INSURANCE COMPANY IMMEDIATELY:
Minor Injuries
If you have sustained a minor injury  
and you want to be treated under the 
Diagnostic and Treatment Protocols 
Regulation*, you must provide your 
insurance company with a completed 
claim form within 10 business days 
of the date of the accident or, if 
that is not reasonable, as soon as 
possible after that to ensure you 
are entitled to medical benefits.
Major or Serious Injuries
If your injuries are not defined as 
“minor,” or you choose not to be treated 
in accordance with the Diagnostic 
and Treatment Protocols Regulation, 
a completed claim form must be 
submitted to your insurer within 30 
days of the accident, or if that is not 
reasonable (e.g., you are in hospital), 
then as soon as possible after that.
* The Diagnostic and Treatment 
Protocols Regulation was introduced 
by the Alberta Government in 2004 
to cap general damages for pain and 
suffering at a legislated amount for 
injuries defined as “minor” and not 
resulting in serious impairment.On November 1, 2020, “minor injury” was 
redefined as sprains, strains or Whiplash-
associated disorder (WAD) injuries that 
do not result in serious impairment 
and expanded to include any clinically 
associated consequences of the sprain, 
strain or WAD injury, whether physical or 
psychological, caused by the accident that 
does not result in serious impairment.
The intent was to increase the 
range of injuries caught by the cap, 
but the key remains whether:
 fthe injuries result in “serious impairment” 
such that you can no longer perform 
the essential tasks of your job, or of an 
education or training program, or other 
normal activities of daily life, 
 fthis has been ongoing since the accident, 
and 
 fyour situation is not expected to improve 
substantially.
An injury that initially appears minor may 
turn out to cause long-term problems.
