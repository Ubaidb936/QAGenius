Knowing the minimum third-party liability coverage required by law is essential information for drivers to ensure they are in compliance with the law and to understand the level of coverage they have in the event of an accident. This information is also important for victims of car accidents to determine if the at-fault driver has sufficient insurance coverage to compensate them for their injuries and damages.\n",
