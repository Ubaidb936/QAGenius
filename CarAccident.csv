6. QUESTIONING UNDER OATH
Once Affidavits of Records have been filed 
and exchanged, all parties to a lawsuit 
must submit to a Questioning Under Oath 
(a “Questioning”). A Questioning is a 
process where you are required to answer 
questions put to you by the Defendant’s 
lawyer relating to your claim. The 
questions and answers are recorded by a 
Court Reporter, and a transcript is created. 
This allows the other side to obtain further 
information from you about your claim 
and learn what your evidence will be if 
your claim proceeds to trial. If your claim 
proceeds to trial the transcript can be used 
as evidence.
Questionings can vary in length from less 
than an hour to several days. They are 
typically conducted in a lawyer’s office, and 
no judge or court official is present. STEPS","What is the purpose of a Questioning Under Oath?
